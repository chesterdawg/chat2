## How to Install Node.js on Mac Sequoia

### Prerequisites Check

Before we start, let's verify your system is ready:

**System Requirements:**
- Mac running Sequoia (macOS 15)
- At least 4GB free disk space
- Admin privileges on your Mac
- Stable internet connection

**Quick System Check:**
1. Click Apple menu ‚Üí About This Mac
2. Verify you're running macOS Sequoia (15.x)
3. Check available storage (should show 4GB+ free)

### Step 1: Check for Existing Node.js Installation

Many Macs already have an older version of Node.js installed. Let's check first to avoid conflicts.

**Open Terminal:**
1. Press `Cmd + Space` to open Spotlight
2. Type "Terminal" and press Enter
3. You'll see a window with white text on black background

**Check for Node.js:**
```bash
node --version
```

**What You'll See:**

*If Node.js is already installed:*
```
v18.19.0
```
(Numbers will vary - this is the version)

*If Node.js is NOT installed:*
```
zsh: command not found: node
```

**If You See a Version Number:**
- Version 20+ ‚Üí ‚úÖ You're good to go, skip to Step 4
- Version 18-19 ‚Üí ‚ö†Ô∏è Update recommended, continue with installation
- Version 16 or lower ‚Üí ‚ùå Must update, continue with installation

### Step 2: Download Node.js LTS

For our NDIS platform, we need the LTS (Long Term Support) version for maximum stability.

**Visit the Official Website:**
1. Open your web browser (Safari, Chrome, etc.)
2. Go to: **https://nodejs.org**
3. You'll see the Node.js homepage

**What You'll See:**
- Large Node.js logo at the top
- Two green download buttons
- Left button: "20.x.x LTS Recommended For Most Users"
- Right button: "21.x.x Current Latest Features"

**Choose LTS (Left Button):**
- Click the **LTS** button (left side)
- This downloads the most stable version
- File will be named something like `node-v20.11.0.pkg`

**Why LTS?**
- **Stability:** Thoroughly tested for production use
- **Long-term Support:** Security updates for 30+ months
- **Business Reliability:** Perfect for your $299/month customer platform
- **Kiro Compatibility:** Guaranteed to work with Kiro IDE

### Step 3: Install Node.js

Once the download completes, let's install Node.js properly.

**Run the Installer:**
1. Find the downloaded `.pkg` file (usually in Downloads folder)
2. Double-click the file to start installation
3. Follow the installation wizard

**Installation Steps:**

**1. Introduction Screen**
- Shows "Install Node.js and npm"
- Click "Continue"

**2. License Agreement**
- Read the software license
- Click "Continue", then "Agree"

**3. Installation Type**
- Shows destination (usually Macintosh HD)
- Shows space required (~75MB)
- Click "Install"

**4. Administrator Password**
- Enter your Mac password (the one you use to log in)
- Click "Install Software"

**5. Installation Progress**
- Green progress bar shows installation status
- Takes 1-2 minutes typically

**6. Summary Screen**
- "The installation was successful"
- Click "Close"

**Why We Need Admin Password:**
Node.js installs system-wide tools that require administrator privileges. This is normal and safe.

### Step 4: Verify Installation Success

Let's confirm Node.js installed correctly and is ready for NDIS development.

**Test Node.js:**
1. Open Terminal (if closed): `Cmd + Space` ‚Üí "Terminal"
2. Type: `node --version`
3. Press Enter

**Expected Output:**
```
v20.11.0
```
(Exact numbers may vary, but should start with v20 or higher)

**Test npm (Node Package Manager):**
1. Type: `npm --version`
2. Press Enter

**Expected Output:**
```
10.2.4
```
(Numbers may vary, should be 9.0 or higher)

**Test Global Installation Path:**
1. Type: `which node`
2. Press Enter

**Expected Output:**
```
/usr/local/bin/node
```

**‚úÖ Success Indicators:**
- All three commands return version numbers or paths
- No "command not found" errors
- Version numbers are current (Node 20+, npm 9+)

**‚ùå Troubleshooting Common Issues:**

*Problem: "command not found: node"*
- **Solution:** Restart Terminal completely and try again
- If still not working, restart your Mac
- Path may need time to update

*Problem: Permission errors during installation*
- **Solution:** Make sure you're using an admin account
- Try right-clicking the installer and selecting "Open"

*Problem: Old version still showing*
- **Solution:** The old version takes precedence
- Type: `which node` to see which version is being used
- May need to update your PATH environment variable

### Step 5: Configure npm for NDIS Development

Let's optimize npm for our professional development workflow.

**Set npm Configuration:**
```bash
# Set npm to use faster registry
npm config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org/

# Configure npm for better error reporting
npm config set loglevel warn

# Set npm to save exact versions (important for business stability)
npm config set save-exact true
```

**Why These Settings Matter:**
- **Faster Registry:** Quicker package downloads
- **Better Logging:** Clear error messages for troubleshooting
- **Exact Versions:** Prevents unexpected updates that could break customer widgets

**Verify npm Configuration:**
```bash
npm config list
```

You should see your settings listed in the output.

## Kiro IDE Integration Preparation

Since our NDIS platform uses Kiro IDE for AI-assisted development, let's prepare Node.js for seamless integration.

**Create Kiro-Compatible Environment:**
```bash
# Create a global directory for npm packages
mkdir ~/.npm-global

# Configure npm to use this directory
npm config set prefix '~/.npm-global'

# Add to your shell profile (for Mac Sequoia with zsh)
echo 'export PATH=~/.npm-global/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.zshrc

# Reload your shell configuration
source ~/.zshrc
```

**Why This Matters:**
- **Kiro Compatibility:** Ensures Kiro can access npm packages
- **Clean Development:** Separates global packages from system
- **Permission Fix:** Avoids permission issues with global installs
- **Professional Setup:** Industry-standard configuration

---

## Next Steps

**Immediate Actions:**
1. ‚úÖ Verify Node.js and npm are working with the commands above
2. ‚úÖ Check that versions are Node 20+ and npm 9+
3. ‚úÖ Test creating a simple test file (optional)

**Quick Test (Optional):**
```bash
# Create a test directory
mkdir ~/ndis-test
cd ~/ndis-test

# Create a simple JavaScript file
echo 'console.log("NDIS Platform Ready!");' > test.js

# Run it with Node.js
node test.js

# Should output: NDIS Platform Ready!

# Clean up
cd ~
rm -rf ~/ndis-test
```
